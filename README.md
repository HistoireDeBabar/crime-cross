Data Collector for Crime Data in the UK

The UK Police offers publically accessible data through an API.  For more information
about how/when and why the data is accessible see https://data.police.uk

This Data Collector will query the open API to gather interesting data, to ultimately
perform analysis and present a clear digestible data map on how the UK police force treat
members of the public.

The project has no agenda, other than to present the data in a clear way which is easily
accessible to whomever wishes to view it.
